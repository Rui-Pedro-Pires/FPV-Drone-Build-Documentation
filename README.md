# FPV Drone Build Documentation

## Overview

This project involves building a 5" freestyle FPV (First Person View) drone from scratch, utilizing various components from well-known manufacturers. The goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience with soldering, configuring, and troubleshooting a drone build from the ground up. The entire process, from assembly to flight configuration, was self-taught.

## Build Process

### 1. **Frame Assembly**
   - The Source One V4 5" frame was selected for its durability and modular design. Assembling the frame involved mounting arms, standoffs, and plates using provided hardware.

### 2. **Motor Mounting and Soldering**
   - Installed the Emax Eco ii 2306 2400kv motors onto the arms of the frame.
   - Each motor was soldered directly to the ESC pads on the Speedybee F405 V3 stack.

### 3. **Flight Controller and ESC Integration**
   - The Speedybee F405 V3 Stack was mounted on the frame using soft rubber mounts to dampen vibrations.
   - Power wires were soldered to the ESCs, and signal wires connected the ESC to the flight controller.
   - Configured ESCs using BLHeli32.

### 4. **Camera and VTX Installation**
   - The Foxeer Razer Mini camera was mounted in the camera cage of the frame. Signal, power, and ground wires were soldered to the flight controller.
   - Installed the JHEMCU 600mw VTX on the frame, ensuring proper heat dissipation, and wired it to the flight controller.

### 5. **Receiver Installation**
   - The BetaFPV 2.4ghz ELRS receiver was soldered to the flight controller and properly positioned for optimal range and signal strength.

### 6. **Power Supply**
   - The Ovonic 4s 1550mah LiPo battery was selected for its balance between capacity and weight, offering sufficient power without compromising agility.

### 7. **Radio and Goggle Setup**
   - Configured the Radiomaster Boxer controller using EdgeTX.
   - Set up and calibrated the FatShark HDO2 goggles for clear video reception.

## Configuration

### 1. **Firmware**
   - Flashed Betaflight firmware onto the Speedybee F405 flight controller using Betaflight Configurator.
   - Calibrated accelerometer, set PID tuning, and configured various flight modes such as Angle, Horizon, and Acro.

### 2. **Motor & ESC Configuration**
   - Configured motor directions and ESC settings via BLHeli32.
   - Calibrated throttle endpoints and motor idle values.

### 3. **VTX and Camera Setup**
   - Set VTX power levels to optimize video transmission without overloading the system.
   - Adjusted camera settings such as exposure and contrast for better visibility.

### 4. **Failsafe and ELRS Receiver**
   - Configured failsafe options in Betaflight to prevent fly-aways.
   - Bound and configured the BetaFPV ELRS 2.4GHz receiver, ensuring low-latency communication with the Radiomaster Boxer.

## Test Flights

- Performed multiple test flights to ensure stability, tune PID settings, and test VTX range.
- Fine-tuned rates and expo to match personal flying style for freestyle flying.

## Challenges & Learning Outcomes

- **Soldering:** Learning proper soldering techniques was crucial to ensuring reliable connections, especially for small pads on the flight controller and ESC.
- **Firmware Configuration:** Understanding Betaflightâ€™s various settings and troubleshooting issues such as gyro calibration and motor direction required persistence and attention to detail.
- **Receiver and VTX Setup:** Configuring the ELRS system for optimal range and troubleshooting video signal issues from the VTX and camera was an in-depth learning experience.

## Conclusion

Building this FPV drone was an insightful project that taught me about both the hardware and software aspects of drone technology. This hands-on experience helped develop problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and a deep understanding of FPV flight dynamics. I plan to continue refining my skills and take on more complex drone projects in the future.
